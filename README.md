# yeenserve

yeenserve is a simple web app written in Rust that serves random images from a directory. It was
written as the backing application for [hyena.photos](https://hyena.photos), as I wanted to replace
the [NGINX random index module](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_random_index_module.html)
that I had been using up until now.
